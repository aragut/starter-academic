I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford. I completed my PhD in Law at the University of Edinburgh. My doctoral research examined the taxonomy of non-pecuniary losses in English law with a particular focus on how this compares to the idea of 'préjudice moral' in French law. I am interested in taxonomy, comparative law, tort law, family law, and private law broadly construed. Prior to my PhD I earned my first degree in Legal and Social Sciences from the University of Chile, and then completed an LLM in European and Comparative Private Law at the University of Edinburgh. I have been visiting and exchange student at Université de Strasbourg, Universität Heidelberg, and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
