I am a Lecturer in Private law at the University of Glasgow where I teach the Law of Torts (Common law programme) and Comparative Tort law. My main areas of interest are legal taxonomy, tort law, contemporary approaches to comparative law and its methodology, and private law broadly construed. Prior to my current position I was an Early Career Fellow in the Law of Obligations at the University of Edinburgh (2022/23) and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford (2021/22). I completed my PhD at the University of Edinburgh. I earned my first degree in Legal and Social Sciences from the University of Chile, and then completed an LLM in European and Comparative Private Law at the University of Edinburgh. I have been visiting and exchange student at Université de Strasbourg, Universität Heidelberg, and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
