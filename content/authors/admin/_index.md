I am a PhD Candidate at the Edinburgh Law School. My research examines the taxonomy of non-pecuniary losses in English law with a particular focus on how this compares to the idea of 'préjudice moral' in French law. I am interested in taxonomy, comparative law, tort law, and private law broadly construed. Prior to my PhD I earned my first degree in Legal and Social Sciences from the University of Chile, and then completed an LLM in European and Comparative Private Law at the University of Edinburgh. I have been visiting and exchange student at the University of Oxford, Université de Strasbourg, Universität Heidelberg, and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
