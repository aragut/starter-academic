## Chilean Network of Comparative Law


I joined the efforts to consolidate the newly established Chilean Network for Comparative Law, where I will act as Director of the Private Law section. Among our objectives are firstly, to create and strenghten the networks among academics and researchers interested in comparative law. A second aim of this network is to foster outreach activities to promote the study and interest in comparative law among the wider legal community, such as practitioners and judges.
