## Translating the Restatement (Third) of the Law of Torts into Spanish

I was part of an international research project on ‘Latin-American Extra-contractual liability’ that included academics from Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Spain, and the American Law Institute. One of its objectives was to produce a comparative account of contemporary tort law in these Latin-American countries, and to publish collaborative volumes accordingly. This four-year project involved translating to Spanish two volumes of the Restatement (Third) of the Law of Torts, namely Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm, as well as Product Liability. In 2023 it resulted in the publication of the book: [Liebman L and Green MD, Restatement of the law third torts. Responsabilidad por daño físico y emocional (Hugo Cárdenas Villarreal and others tr, Tirant lo Blanch 2023)](https://www.marcialpons.es/libros/restatement-of-the-law-third-torts/9788411693264/). I was part of the team who translated and edited the volume. An international conference was organised in July 2023 in Santiago de Chile to both present the translation as well as discuss original papers from a number of academics involved in the project. I presented a paper on damages in the context of infringements to privacy in French, English and Chilean law. The proceedings will be published in early 2024.
