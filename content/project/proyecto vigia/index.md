## Observatory of the rulings of the Chilean Supreme Court


This project is following the weekly rulings made by the Chilean Supreme Court, filtering and analysing the most important ones so as to highlight emerging trends, and critically assess the most relevant shifts in doctrinal issues of Chilean private law. I am a collaborator of this initiative and as such I review and report a number of the court's rulings every six weeks.
