summary: I was a member of a project that reviewed and reported all recent cases handed by the Chilean Supreme which dealt with private law issues. This resulted in several reports identifying emerging trends and a course delivered at the University of Chile.

## Observatory of the rulings of the Chilean Supreme Court


This project followed the cases decided by the Chilean Supreme Court on a weekly basis and different academics took turns to analyse emerging trends in the area of Chilean private law. For over two years I was a regular contributor to this initiative and as such I reviewed and reported a number of the court's decisions.
